    Happy Birthday Dylan!
    Congrats on graduating! I am very proud of you. I know we don't talk super often but just remember you 
    can always reach out to me if you ever need anything. I noticed a couple of times you complimenting me on my 'Panda Dunks'. 
    And I knew that you were never really into shoes/fashion like that. My idea was to get you a pair. I hope you enjoy the gift. 
    Oh! And I remember you mentioned you like when people talk or present their passions. So here is mine, a little website I made for you, 
    with your own custom domain that you get to keep! I know you like handwritten letters, but this is something that is still tangible, and 
    you will be able to keep as well (just digitally) I will be making updates to this every year for your bday as I 
    get better at producing sites. 
    Love you man.
    You are the funniest guy that I know, and I already know you will accomplish a lot in life. Just make sure to stay 
    postiive, and open to new things. Sometimes what you are looking for is right in front of you.</p>
    [Henry, Nathan, Emily, Peter, Brandon, + Richard helped contribute to getting you the Pandas. :)]

    happy birthday!
    I hope that you are having a great bday man.
    congrats on graduating from CSUS!! (fuck school)
    I will never forget the times in your room. laughing our asses off, in the 100+ degree weather.
    that was some of the most memorable stuff ever, especially when you pretended to be dragged down the stairs....
    I also won't forget going to CSUS for your smash tourney and seeing you get your ass eaten and spit out.
    (that was some crazy shit)regardless, I don't want to keep this too long, thus, here is the purpose of this website.

<p><b>update #1:</b></p>
<p>I am very grateful for you as my friend throughout these past couple of years. 
    Life hit me pretty hard in 2019, and you were one of the many people that had my back during that time
    I will always feel guilty for not being there for you as much as I should have during the time period when things were happening with your mom & grandpa.
    May he rest in peace.
    I am so proud of the development that you have had as a person.
    Once again, I have regret that we weren't closer before (like in HS), but it's alright. Life just be like that. 
    I know that we don't talk much, but, I always have you in my heart.
    You are legit the strongest person that I know and I could never have asked for a better friend.
    With all of the shit that you went through recently, and how you bounced back, I look up to you, and have the upmost respect for you. 
    That is not an easy thing to do Dylan, I hope you are aware of that. You had to dig deep within yourself, and change. That is not for the weak. If you ever need to be reminded of how much you have accomplished, just come back every now and then to read this note. 
    
    you probably aren't going to see this little update to the site that I made unless you consistently are checking it.</p>
